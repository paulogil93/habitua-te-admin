# Habitua-te Admin

In order to manage all the content in the app (Drinks, Events, Users, etc.) it was necessary to have a Admin Dashboard. Thus, Django was chosen to be the framework used to achieve this goal.

_Django_ is a Python-based free and open-source web framework, which follows the model-template-view architectural pattern. With _Django_ you can focus on writing the app without needing to reinvent the wheel.
